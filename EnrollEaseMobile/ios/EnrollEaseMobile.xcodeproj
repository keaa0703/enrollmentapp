### Prerequisites

   - Ensure that the `minSdkVersion`, `targetSdkVersion`, and other configurations are set according to your requirements.

3. **Build the Project**:
   - Go to the menu bar and select `Build` > `Make Project` to compile the project and check for any errors.

4. **Generate Signed APK**:
